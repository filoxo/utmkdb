# utmkdb

An attempt at a simple webapp for the UTMK keyboard database

### Development

To develop locally, you'll need to use your own Airtable API key. It needs to be stored as an env variable.

* Create a file named `.env.local`
* In it, add the following:

      REACT_APP_AIRTABLE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>

#### Start

Run the local dev server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
